# Loading bar thingy

I made this in rust as a first little project because I have previously not used it before. It is a simple loading bar that can be used in the terminal. It is not very customizable but it is a good start.
When running it will ask for an input of how long the loading bar will take. This in milliseconds. After that it will start the loading bar and when it is done it automatically exits.
