# Loading bar thingy

I made this in Rust as a first little project because I have previously not used it before. It is a simple loading bar that can be used in the terminal. It is not very customizable but it is a good start.
When running it will ask for an input of how long the loading bar will take; this in milliseconds; After that it will start the loading bar and when it is done it automatically exits.
